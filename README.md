# IPL Data Analysis (2008-2020)

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2020. Using two primary datasets—**IPL Matches 2008-2020** (match-level data) and **IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020** (ball-by-ball records)—the project uncovers insights into team performance, player statistics, and match dynamics. Key areas of focus include:

- **General Match Statistics**: Total matches, venues, toss outcomes, and player awards.
- **Team Performance**: Success rates in tosses and match wins across seasons.
- **Player Analysis**: In-depth performance breakdowns, with a special focus on Virat Kohli.

The analysis is presented through visualizations, statistical summaries, and actionable insights, making it a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and data scientists.
